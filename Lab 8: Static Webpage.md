#Introduction

The webpage was formed using Apache, a program for Raspberry Pi that is used for the creation of servers and webpages. This program was chosen because it had a lot of resources available online as well as the ability to add dynamic features.

##Problem Definition:

The webpage would allow the user to have access to a variety of data about the coop including the temperature, access to egg detection images, the humidity, and the food level. For this lab, the goal was to see that a webpage could be created and accessed. Further labs will allow for the addition of information to the webpage.

##Conclusion

In conclusion, the web page is a vital part of this project. It allows the user to be able to see information that would normally only be available via a video cable from the pi/arduinos.
