#Description
The Raspberry Piâ€™s camera feature can be used to create timelapse pictures. These pictures are saved into a folder, which is relayed, to the dynamic web page.  

##Problem Definition: A system needed to be in place so that the user of the Coop-a-cabana smart coop would be able to know whether there were eggs present inside of the coop

##Engineering data
Attached is the timelapse code for the raspberry pi. 

NOTE: The camera function must be turned on in the raspberry pi for it to be able to use the camera port.
