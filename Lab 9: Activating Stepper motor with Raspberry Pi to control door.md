##Introduction

In this lab we will be using 12 VDC bipolar stepper motor (angle 5.625 degrees/ 64 steps). Stepper motors can be positioned accurately, moved forward or backwards one step at a time. They are bipolar and can also rotate continuously. In this lab we will learn how to control a stepper motor using your Raspberry Pi and L298D dual H bridge driver. (Write about driver)
