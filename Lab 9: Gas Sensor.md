# PURPOSE #
In this lab I will set up a gas sensor as part of my group project to monitor the inside conditions of a chicken coop.

Figure 1. Block diagram for gas sensor.

I set up gas sensor that can detect different gases from methane, CO2, and ethanol.  I connected the sensor to a Pickit Max32 board as seen in Figure 2.  I borrowed C code from an online Arduino projects community to program the board and sensor.

### CONCLUSION ###
There many varieties gas sensors, and their set up is fairly straight forward.  The sensor though needs to let warmed up or broken-in before it can take accurate data, and this can take several hours.  I do not know if the calibration is correct yet.
