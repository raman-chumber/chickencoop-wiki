# INTRODUCTION #
In this lab I will create a phone application using the MIT App Inventor. 

## PROCEDURE ##
We will be making a sample app.  I first logged on through my gmail account to access the MIT App Inventor main page.  I then download two files.  The first was a picture of a cat while the second was an audio file of meow.

Figure 1. Palette with list of tools.

I then selected the Button tool from the palette as seen in figure 1.  This placed button on a work area.  From this, I was able to attach the picture of the cat and meow audio file to the button as seen in Figure 2.

I then added the text “Pet the Kitty” below the image of the cat as seen in Figure 3.

Figure 3. 1st page with cat picture and text.

Once this was complete, I clicked on a button called “Blocks.”  This took me to a page that help me program the actual app.  The code was based on shapes that were tied to the button on the other page as seen in Figure 4 that fit into each other.  Once this was complete, the app was built.

Figure 4. Blocks used to code the app.

A barcode was created.  I then scanned the code with my cell phone, and the app was loaded onto my phone.  Every time I touch the image of the cat on my phone, my phone vibrates and meows.

### CONCLUSION ###
The program gives a rudimentary but very useful tool to make apps.  Although the list of tools available to manipulate a phone were limited, it gives a powerful opportunity to begin the process of immersing one in the world of app development and start getting creative.
