#Description
The dynamic webpage is very similar to the static webpage but allows the user to monitor the status of the coop. Its most important feature is access to the timelapse pictures. It posts the most recent picture as well as posting about the temperature and humidity from the combined sensor, as well as the status of the small chicken door (whether or not it is open or closed)

#Problem Definition
The dynamic webpage is created so that the user can view what the status of the coop and many of its parameters are. It also is used to see the timelapse images so that they can tell if there is an issue of if there are eggs present to be collected.
