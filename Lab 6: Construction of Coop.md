#Description
Building the coop is the first piece of creating a working project. The coop was to be a walk-in chicken coop with smart features that would help to make caring for chickens an easy process. 

##Problem Definition
The coop was designed to be 4’ wide by 6’ long by 6’ tall. It was build to have room for 8 chickens with a lot of room for smart features to be mounted. It features a composite roof as well as reflective heat shielding OSB to keep the chicken coop as insulated as possible. The coop features lots of frame reinforcement so that it can easily be lifted in and out of the trailer using a tractor.
