For this lab I got a temperature and humidity sensor to monitor the inside of the coop.  I connected the sensor to a Pickit Max32.  I borrowed the C language code from an Arduino project website to program the Max32 and the sensor.

### CONCLUSION ###
The temperature and humidity sensor is very useful because it has already been used on many projects posted online.  This gives it a good track record and it can be part of more complex projects.
