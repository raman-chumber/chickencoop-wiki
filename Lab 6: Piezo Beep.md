# PURPOSE #
In this lab I had to set and make a beeping component beep at an audible level.

Figure 2. Model of Beep setup.

I followed Figure 1 and 2 setup graphics to setup and connect the beep component to the Parallax board.  I then got the C language code from a Parallax sample.  Once I compiled and made sure the code had no bugs, I loaded the code into the beep.  Within a few seconds, a low frequency beep could be heard.

### CONCLUSION ###
This lab was straight forward.  The beep component is a useful tool that can supplemented to just any project.  It can almost me used in place of an LED when a flag is needed.
