# Smart Chicken Coop

**EEE174/CpE185 Project** 

**Team Name: Coop-a-Cabana**   
                      

## Introduction

The project will be a chicken coop that uses sensors and communication systems to make it
easy for someone who has limited time or experience to be able to house chickens safely. The
sensors will include a temperature sensor that will use controllers to determine the intensity of
heat lamps, a flow sensor that will be placed in conjunction with the automatic waterer to
determine if there is a leak or a clog in the system. The roof will have solar panels that will
charge a battery system to power all of these devices. There will be a weight sensor that when
properly calibrated will inform the user if there is an egg. There will be a smoke detector that will
activate a small sprinkler off of the watererâ€™s supply if smoke is detected as a fire safety device if
the heat lamps fail. A motor will be used to spin an arm that spreads feed out at specified times.
