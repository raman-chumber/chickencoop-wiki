**Introduction**
This lab uses a TSL2591 luminosity sensor. It is an advanced digital light sensor which is ideal for wide range of light situations. It is a very precise sensor that allow exact lux calculations and can configure for different gain/timing ranges to detect light ranges from 188uLux up to 88,000 Lux on the fly. It contains both Infrared and full spectrum diodes. We can measure infrared, full-spectrum or human-visible light separately.
